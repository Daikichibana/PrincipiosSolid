## SOLID: SRP

The single responsibility principle (SRP) instructs developers to write code that has one and only one
reason to change. If a class has more than one reason to change, it has more than one responsibility. 
Classes with more than a single responsibility should be broken down into smaller classes, each of 
which should have only one responsibility and reason to change.
